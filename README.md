# Super Colonial Adventures
A game abouit fruitless pursuits

## Introduction

In Super Colonial Adventures, you play as an Imperial Power trying to conquer the Kingdom of The Other. Why? Because it's the only left land to conquer, and you don't want anybody else to get there before you do. Besides, although nobody has been in the Kingdom of The Other for years, old legends tell that the Kingdom has immense riches, similar to the El Dorado or the Land of Priester John. 

So you ready the Imperial Army for conquest, but as a wise man once said, you go to war with the army you have, not the army your wish for. All your Generals are close to retirement, if not the grave, and during their long careers they were more known for they impressive drills and spectacular parades than for their military prowess. Your armament is left over from the previous war, and the least is said about your men, the better. But fear not, young Emperor! Heavens are with us, and you shall prevail!
